terraform aws github action workflow example with tests

Contains an example workflow for terraform and github actions incorporating:
- terrascan for security scanning before running terraform  
- inspec for testing after running terraform 

This provides a simple terraform workflow that includes tests. 
Example uses terraform workspaces and AWS assume roles. 

The approach is on a pull request the workflow is run without the terraform apply and when it is merged with main branch the terraform apply is also run.  

NOTE: It is recommended to run this on your hosted github runners rather than github's runners so you keep your AWS credentials out of github. 


## Repository Contents 

### profile directory 

Contains an example inspec test against AWS. you need to be authenticated against a valid AWS account to run the tests 

### terraform directory 

Contains a test project with known bad terraform to run tfsec against.

Uses S3 buckets for testing example 

This project has a number of issues that are known to fail tfsec checks.

## Usage 

- git clone repo 
- create a new branch 
- push changes to github 
- Create Pull Request and see github action CI workflow run
